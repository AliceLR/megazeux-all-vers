Usage:

1) "make -j8" to download and install every MZX version.
2) "source alias" to set up the MZX version aliases.
3) Do one of these to run an MZX version:

a. Use the batch file directly (cmd):	MZX 2.51
b. Use the alias (bash):		251

The alias will be the same as the version number but without any decimal points.
