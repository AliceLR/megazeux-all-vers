Usage:

1) "make -j8" to download and install every MZX version.
2) "source alias" to set up the MZX version aliases.
3) Do one of these to run an MZX version:

a. Use the batch file directly (cmd):	MZX 2.51
b. Use the shell file directly (bash):	./MZX.sh 2.51
c. Use the alias (bash):		251

The alias will be the same as the version number but without any decimal points.
Using the alias version is recommended because the batch version does not
currently allow the ability to pass command line options to port versions of
MegaZeux.
